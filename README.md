# Welcome to Metric Coders! ðŸ‘‹

We are building the world's largest open-source AI SaaS platform. Our repository comprises of various full-stack websites that use AI models, datasets, notebooks, full stack LLM applications, Indic language models, and more. Our projects are implemented using a variety of Javascript frameworks such as Next JS, React JS and ML models using PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn and Langchain. We are constantly creating notebooks to fine tune Large Language Models (LLMs) with custom data. Our blog is www.metriccoders.com and feel free to star our repositories if you like them.

It is created and maintained by Suhas.
