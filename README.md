# Welcome to Metric Coders! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Suhas Bhairav and I'm building the world's largest open-source AI SaaS platform called Metric Coders. The repository comprises of various full-stack websites that use AI models, datasets, notebooks, full stack LLM applications, Indic language models, Artificial Intelligence Studio, and more. The projects are implemented using a variety of Javascript frameworks such as Next JS, React JS and ML models using PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn and Langchain. I'm constantly creating notebooks to fine tune Large Language Models (LLMs) with custom data. My blog is www.metriccoders.com and feel free to star my repositories if you like them.

## Main Project
My main project right now is creating AI Studio, a web platform to train Machine Learning models in scikit-learn.

## My Mission ðŸš€

My mission is to democratize AI and make it accessible to everyone. I believe in the power of open-source and the impact it can have on the world. I invite you to join me on this journey!

## Projects ðŸ“š

Here are some of the projects I'm working on:

- **AI Studio**: I'm developing a no-code software to train, download and deploy ML models.
- **Full Stack LLM Applications**: I'm developing end-to-end applications using Large Language Models. This includes AI SaaS applications, including ones powered by Langchain.
- **AI Models**: I have a collection of state-of-the-art AI models for a variety of tasks.
- **Datasets**: I provide high-quality datasets for training and testing AI models.
- **Notebooks**: I share Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab and Python programs that demonstrate how to implement and use different AI models and datasets.
- **Large Language Models**: I share Google Colab notebooks containing code to fine tune Large Language Models (LLMs) with custom data.
- **Indic Language Models**: I'm working on models specifically designed for Indic languages.
