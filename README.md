# Welcome to Metric Coders! ðŸ‘‹

We are building the largest open-source AI community. Our repository comprises of various AI models, datasets, notebooks, full stack LLM applications, Indic language models, and more. Our projects are implemented using a variety of frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn. Our website is www.metriccoders.com and feel free to star our repositories if you like them.

## Our Mission ðŸš€

Our mission is to democratize AI and make it accessible to everyone. We believe in the power of open-source and the impact it can have on the world. We invite you to join us on this journey!

## Projects ðŸ“š

Here are some of the projects we're working on:

- **AI Models**: We have a collection of state-of-the-art AI models for a variety of tasks.
- **Datasets**: We provide high-quality datasets for training and testing AI models.
- **Notebooks**: We share Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab and Python programs that demonstrate how to implement and use different AI models and datasets.
- **Full Stack LLM Applications**: We're developing end-to-end applications using Large Language Models.
- **Indic Language Models**: We're working on models specifically designed for Indic languages.
